## R Markdown Assignment 1

This is a R Markdown document writen as a part of Assignment Project 1 for Reproducible Research Course by [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) via [Coursera](https://coursera.org).
  
  This Assignment contains 5 parts showing 9 steps of full submission:


1. Loading and preprocessing the data 
2. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day 
3. Mean and median number of steps taken each day
4. Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
5. The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
6. Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
7. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
8. Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

Every part contains the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report
